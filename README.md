* Physical layer: This is the lowest layer that deals with the physical transmission of the data bits. It also handles bit synchronization, bit rate control, physical topologies, and transmission modes.

* Data link layer: This layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the data frames. It also handles framing, error detection, error correction, and media access control.

* Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing the data packets across different networks. It also handles addressing, fragmentation, reassembly, and logical network topology.

* Transport layer: This layer ensures reliable and error-free data transmission between the source and destination. It provides services such as segmentation, reassembly, flow control, congestion control, and error detection and correction.

* Session layer: This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates the sessions between different applications. It also manages the synchronization, dialogue control, and recovery of data exchange.

* Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for translating the data between different formats, such as ASCII, EBCDIC, JPEG, etc. It also handles compression, decompression, encryption, and decryption of data4.

* Application layer: This is the topmost layer that interacts with the user applications, such as web browsers, email clients, etc. It provides services such as data formatting, encryption, authentication, and file transfer.

  * Tried to run Hello World on [ZCU102](https://docs.xilinx.com/v/u/en-US/ug1182-zcu102-eval-bd) evaluation kit.

  * Got familiar with vitis ai and attempted to run hello world.
